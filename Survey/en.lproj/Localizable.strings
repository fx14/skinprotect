// App Description
app_description = "With this innovative app you can find out how many cosmetic and cleaning products you use regularly and compare your consumption with your peers. In addition, you can easily report the products used with the help of an integrated barcode scanner. In addition to a feedback on the app, delivered by the app, there is the opportunity to get a more detailed scientific evaluation by email. Your data is collected anonymously for scientific purposes and is a valuable contribution to a research study at the ETH Zurich. Thanks to your answers about the quantities, types of product and brand used it would be possible to gain new insights into how much the Swiss population is exposed to certain ingredients present in consumer products.";
